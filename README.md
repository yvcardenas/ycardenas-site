## Compression
After enabling mod_deflate on Apache, my HTML, CSS, and JS files were compressed before being sent to the browser. In Chrome DevTools, the Content-Encoding: gzip header confirmed the compression. This reduces file size and improves page load time.

## Obscuring the Server's Identity
I set up another program called Nginx in front of my Apache server so it handles all requests first. I made Apache only listen privately, then told Nginx to hide Apacheâ€™s information and replace it with the custom text Server: CSE135 Server before sending responses back to visitors.
