      <h2>Get to Know Me!</h2>
      <p>My name is Yvanna Cardenas Beltran. I am a computer science student enrolled in the University of California, San Diego, class of June 2026. I seek technology skills because of my urge to solve problems, work well in a team, and develop functional solutions that offer a voice to the community.</p>
